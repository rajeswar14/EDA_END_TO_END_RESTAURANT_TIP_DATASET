# Tips Dataset Analysis

This project analyzes the "tips" dataset using Python, focusing on data visualization and exploratory data analysis.

## Overview

This Jupyter notebook explores the "tips" dataset, which contains information about restaurant bills and tips. The analysis includes:

- Data loading and initial exploration
- Descriptive statistics
- Data visualization using various plot types

## Contents

- `tips_analysis.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing all the analysis code
- `tips.csv`: Dataset file (not included in the repository)

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- NumPy

## Setup and Usage

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the required libraries:
3. Ensure you have the `tips.csv` file in the same directory as the notebook
4. Open and run the Jupyter notebook

## Data Description

The dataset includes the following columns:
- total_bill: Total bill amount
- tip: Tip amount
- sex: Gender of the bill payer
- smoker: Whether the party included smokers
- day: Day of the week
- time: Time of day (Dinner or Lunch)
- size: Number of people in the party

## Analysis Highlights

The notebook covers:
1. Data loading and initial exploration
2. Descriptive statistics for numerical and categorical variables
3. Distribution plots for continuous variables
4. Scatter plots to explore relationships between variables
5. Categorical data analysis

## Visualizations

The project includes various types of plots:
- Histograms
- Scatter plots
- Box plots
- Violin plots

## Future Work

Potential areas for further analysis:
- Statistical tests to confirm observed patterns
- Predictive modeling for tip amounts
- Time series analysis if date information is available
